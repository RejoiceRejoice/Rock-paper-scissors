# Rock-paper-scissors
Rock-- Paper -- Scissors
This project is a simple automated game for a player and the CPU.
It was created with Python using Visual studio code.
Open the main.py file using any code editor, preferably VScode.
Run the file by opening a terminal.
Once the file runs, enter the letter of your choice(R,P,S)to play.
Wait for the CPU to play.
A tie doesn't count and the first player to reach 3 points wins.
